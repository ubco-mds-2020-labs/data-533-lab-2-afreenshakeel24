# This program is a simple game-code where you (the player) and computer competes against each other. The game is called Rock-Paper-Scissors. There is also an advanced version of this game for the fans of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory. 

If you don't know who Sheldon Cooper or what The Big Bang Theory is, we highly recommend you to watch it on Netflix. But for the purpose of game, please check: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8


## What is it? 
An easy, fast game that everyone probably already knows. But we like to be comprehensive, so here we go with some rock-paper-scissors instructions. Rock-paper-scissors is a quick win-loose game that is often used to determine who will go first or who will win some other small privilege.

## Best for: 
Two players. But you could have a giant rock-paper-scissors tournament with tons of people! In this case, the game is between you (the player) and computer.

## What you need: 
A fun mood.

## How to play: 
In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three signs: rock, paper, or scissors. 
Both players show their signs to see who will win. Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:

Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)
Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)
Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)
